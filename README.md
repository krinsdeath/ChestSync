ChestSync
=========

>   A fairly straightforward plugin that allows you to sync chest inventories (both single and double) over any distance,
>   possibly even across worlds (which is untested). Simply put "synced chest" on line 1, and a name for your new chest
>   network on line 2, such as your own name, and it will sync up. Every chest you add after that with the same name will
>   have the same inventory as the other chests on that network.
